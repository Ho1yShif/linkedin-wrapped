# TODO

	- Don’t light up cards on hover
	- Make top posts cards clickable
	- Align all cards
	- Things shouldn’t pretend to be clickable
	- Remove blue outlines if not clickable
- Move the metrics under `Top posts` into the `Your year at a glance` section
	- Also move tiles (Total impressions, Members Reached, likes/comments/shares) under `Your year at a glance`
	- Make the `Year at a glance` section more prominent and similar to the `Top posts` section
- Remove explicit ordering for top posts section and use the same ordering in the spreadsheet since it's already sorted by engagements

- Ensure polars join for weird top posts format is optimized
- Optimize Polars parsing speed

	- Steps to turn on creator mode
